## 🔍 Issues Found & Fixed

### 🚨 Critical Issues (RESOLVED)
1. **Firebase Package Conflict** ❌ → ✅
   - **Problem**: Both `firebase@12.1.0` (web SDK) and `@react-native-firebase` (native SDK) were installed
   - **Solution**: Removed conflicting `firebase` web package
   - **Impact**: Prevents runtime crashes and memory conflicts

2. **Unused Dependencies** ❌ → ✅
   - **Problem**: `@react-navigation/material-bottom-tabs` was installed but unused
   - **Solution**: Removed unused package to clean dependency tree
   - **Impact**: Reduced bundle size and potential conflicts

3. **Web Firebase Configuration** ❌ → ✅
   - **Problem**: `firebaseWeb.ts` file contained web SDK configuration in mobile app
   - **Solution**: Removed the file as it's not needed for React Native
   - **Impact**: Eliminated confusion and potential import errors

### ⚠️ Build Warnings (ACCEPTABLE)
- Firebase native modules show deprecation warnings - these are library-level and don't affect functionality
- React Native Screens shows edge-to-edge warnings for Android SDK 35 - these are informational only
